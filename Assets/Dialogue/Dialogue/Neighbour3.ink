Well pardon me, I couldn't help but notice your little plan of infringement.. You're looking to light things up a little aren't you? #speaker:Neighbour 3 #portrait:Neighbour3 #layout:left

Don´t worry, I won't mention any of this to the guards. If you're looking for a distraction to sneak outside the village, lighting one of the lamps will do. Once the gentle flame is noticed, they will surely arrive at godspeed to turn it off since today is not the day of the festival. #speaker:Neighbour 3 #portrait:Neighbour3 #layout:left
I see, thank you for your advice but.. Why are you helping me? #portrait:guang #speaker:Guang Jiyi #layout:right 
Is there something wrong with helping those in need? Besides, what truly matters is that you don't cross the second gate towards the pillar valley. #speaker:Neighbour 3 #portrait:Neighbour3 #layout:left
These gates simply serve as checkpoints in the unfortunate event where an individual manages to sneak through. After the first gate, they will surely dash unruly towards the second at which they will have ample time due to the distance between the two. Goodluck! #speaker:Neighbour 3 #portrait:Neighbour3 #layout:left
