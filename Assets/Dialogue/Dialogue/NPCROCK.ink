Hello friend, my Grandfather used to climb these mountains but now theyre almost impossible to climb. #speaker:Neighbour 3 #portrait:Neighbour3 #layout:left
How do you suggest I get to the shrine? #portrait:guang #speaker:Guang Jiyi #layout:right 
I found a way to glide across, simply take a big run up, leap and press <color=\#F8FF30>E</color> #speaker:Neighbour 3 #portrait:Neighbour3 #layout:left
You can also press <color=\#F8FF30>Q</color> to scale the mountains if you lose your footing, be careful #speaker:Neighbour 3 #portrait:Neighbour3 #layout:left
