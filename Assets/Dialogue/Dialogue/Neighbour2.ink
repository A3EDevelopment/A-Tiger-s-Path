Hey you, where do you think you're going? #speaker:Neighbour 2 #portrait:Neighbour2 #layout:left
Somewhere which doesn't concern the likes of you. #portrait:guang #speaker:Guang Jiyi #layout:right 
Glad to see your barbaric manners are still as refined as usual. Wish I could say the same about your appearance however. #speaker:Neighbour 2 #portrait:Neighbour2 #layout:left
Get to the point, will you? #portrait:guang #speaker:Guang Jiyi #layout:right 
You seem to be having quite the expeditious stroll around the village. So I'll be brief. I overheard your conversation and I´m afraid you cannot meet the elder right now. #speaker:Neighbour 2 #portrait:Neighbour2 #layout:left
And why is that? #portrait:guang #speaker:Guang Jiyi #layout:right 
Had you paid any attention to the elder´s lectures, you would know by now that it is far too dangerous to venture outside the village, especially for a girl such as yourself. #speaker:Neighbour 2 #portrait:Neighbour2 #layout:left
But of course I have nothing to worry about. After all, if the beast itself and you were placed side by side, I wouldn't be able to tell who the Nian is. #speaker:Neighbour 2 #portrait:Neighbour2 #layout:left
Then perhaps you should start worrying more about your own welfare, seeing as though your eyesight seems to be lacking in “refinement” #portrait:guang #speaker:Guang Jiyi #layout:right
