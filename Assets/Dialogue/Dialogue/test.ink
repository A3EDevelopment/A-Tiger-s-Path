Ah it’s you Guang Jiyi! I see you’ve finally woken up from your slumber.#speaker:Neighbour #portrait:Neighbour #layout:left
Nevermind that, there’s more important things to discuss. #portrait:guang #speaker:Guang Jiyi #layout:right 
Like what exactly? #speaker:Neighbour#portrait:Neighbour#layout:left
Like where is the Elder? That’d be a good start. #portrait:guang #speaker:Guang Jiyi #layout:right 
Woah what’s up with the urgency. Anyway, the last time I saw him, he was walking around the village looking for something #speaker:Neighbour #portrait:Neighbour #layout:left
Around the village.. Can you be more specific? #portrait:guang #speaker:Guang Jiyi #layout:right 
I bet my only 2 coins on the fact that he’s at the very bottom of the stairs.#speaker:Neighbour #portrait:Neighbour #layout:left
I see, I’ll have a look #portrait:guang #speaker:Guang Jiyi #layout:right 
At his age, I would assume he would avoid walking up. His back is not what it used to be #speaker:Neighbour #portrait:Neighbour #layout:left
